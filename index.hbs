        <h1>About This Course</h1>

        <div class="module">
            <p>Bloomberg presents "Foundations of Machine Learning," a training course that was initially delivered internally to the company's software engineers as part of its "Machine Learning EDU" initiative. This course covers a wide variety of topics in machine learning and statistical modeling. The primary goal of the class is to help participants gain a deep understanding of the concepts, techniques and mathematical frameworks used by experts in machine learning. It is designed to make valuable machine learning skills more accessible to individuals with a strong math background, including software developers, experimental scientists, engineers and financial professionals.</p>

            <p>The 30 lectures in the course are embedded below, but may also be viewed in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnZuxOufsXnvftwTB1HL6mel1V32w0ThI">YouTube playlist</a>. The course includes a complete set of homework assignments, each containing a theoretical element and implementation challenge with support code in Python, which is rapidly becoming the prevailing programming language for data science and machine learning in both academia and industry. This course also serves as a foundation on which more specialized courses and further independent study can build.</p>

            <p>Please fill out <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeyq3l0U3SOX5km78Bg_JcRZWg5XtWpy3n5dEw3kbt3YudIZw/viewform?usp=sf_link">this short online form</a> to register for access to our course's <a href="https://piazza.com/">Piazza</a> discussion board. Applications are processed manually, so please be patient.  You should receive an email directly from Piazza when you are registered. Common questions from this and previous editions of the course are posted in our <a href="https://github.com/davidrosenberg/mlcourse/blob/gh-pages/course-faq.md">FAQ</a>.</p>

                <h1>Highlights and Distinctive Features of the Course Lectures, Notes, and Assignments</h1>

                <ul>
                    <li>Geometric explanation for what happens with ridge, lasso, and elastic net regression in the case of correlated random variables.</li>
                    <li>Investigation of when the penalty (Tikhonov) and constraint (Ivanov) forms of regularization are equivalent.</li>
                    <li>Concise summary of what we really learn about SVMs from Lagrangian duality.</li>
                    <li>Proof of representer theorem with simple linear algebra, emphasizing it as a way to reparametrize certain objective functions.</li>
                    <li>Guided derivation of the math behind the classic diamond/circle/ellipsoids picture that "explains" why L1 regularization gives sparsity (Homework 2, Problem 5)</li>
                    <li>From scrach (in numpy) implementation of almost all major ML algorithms we discuss: ridge regression with SGD and GD (Homework 1, Problems 2.5, 2.6 page 4), lasso regression with the shooting algorithm (Homework 2, Problem 3, page 4), kernel ridge regression (Homework 4, Problem 3, page 2), kernelized SVM with Kernelized Pegasos (Homework 4, 6.4, page 9), L2-regularized logistic regression (Homework 5, Problem 3.3, page 4),Bayesian Linear Regession (Homework 5, problem 5, page 6), multiclass SVM (Homework 6, Problem 4.2, p. 3), classification and regression trees (without pruning)  (Homework 6, Problem 6), gradient boosting with trees for classification and regression (Homework 6, Problem 8), multilayer perceptron for regression (Homework 7, Problem 4, page 3)</li>
                    <li>Repeated use of a simple 1-dimensional regression dataset, so it's easy to visualize the effect of various hypothesis spaces and regularizations that we investigate throughout the course.</li>
                    <li>Investigation of how to derive a conditional probability estimate from a predicted score for various loss functions, and why it's not so straightforward for the hinge loss (i.e. the SVM) (Homework 5, Problem 2, page 1)</li>

                <h1>Prerequisites</h1>

                <p>The quickest way to see if the mathematics level of the course is for you is to take a look at this <a href="https://davidrosenberg.github.io/mlcourse/Notes/prereq-questions/math-questions.pdf">mathematics assessment</a>, which is a preview of some of the math concepts that show up in the first part of the course.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Solid mathematical background</strong>, equivalent to a 1-semester undergraduate course in each of the following: linear algebra, multivariate differential calculus, probability theory, and statistics. The content of NYU's <a href="http://www.cims.nyu.edu/~cfgranda/pages/DSGA1002_fall15/index.html"><strong>DS-GA-1002: Statistical and Mathematical Methods</strong></a> would be more than sufficient, for example.</li>
                    <li><strong>Python programming required</strong> for most homework assignments.</li>
                    <li><em>Recommended:</em> At least one advanced, proof-based mathematics course</li>
                    <li><em>Recommended:</em> Computer science background up to a "data structures and algorithms" course</li>
                </ul>

                <dt><a href="https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/hands-on-machine-learning/9781492032632/"><cite>Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow, 2nd Edition</cite> (Aurélien Géron)</a></dt>
                <dd>This is a practical guide to machine learning that corresponds fairly well with the content and level of our course.  While most of our homework is about coding ML from scratch with numpy, this book makes heavy use of scikit-learn and TensorFlow. We'll use the first two chapters of this book in the first two weeks of the course, when we cover "black-box machine learning."  It'll also be a handy reference for your projects and beyond this course, when you'll want to make use of existing ML packages, rather than rolling your own.</dd>

                <dt><a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/"><cite>The Elements of Statistical Learning</cite> (Hastie, Friedman, and Tibshirani)</a></dt>
                <dd>This will be our main textbook for L1 and L2 regularization, trees, bagging, random forests, and boosting.  It's written by three statisticians who invented many of the techniques discussed. There's an easier version of this book that covers many of the same topics, described below. (Available for free as a PDF.)</dd>

                <dt><a href="http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/"><cite>An Introduction to Statistical Learning</cite> (James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani)</a></dt>
                <dd>This book is written by two of the same authors as The Elements of Statistical Learning. It's much less intense mathematically, and it's good for a lighter introduction to the topics. Uses R as the language of instruction.  (Available for free as a PDF.)</dd>

                <dt><a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/"><cite>Understanding Machine Learning: From Theory to Algorithms</cite> (Shalev-Shwartz and Ben-David)</a></dt>
                <dd>This is our primary reference for kernel methods and multiclass classification, and possibly more towards the end of the course.  Covers a lot of theory that we don't go into, but it would be a good supplemental resource for a more theoretical course, such as Mohri's <a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/ml16/">Foundations of Machine Learning</a> course. (Available for free as a PDF.)</dd>

                <dt><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/"><cite>Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning</cite> (Christopher Bishop)</a></dt>
                <dd>Our primary reference for probabilistic methods, including bayesian regression, latent variable models, and the EM algorithm.  (Available for free as a PDF.)</dd>

                <dt><a href="http://www.data-science-for-biz.com"><cite>Data Science for Business</cite> (Provost and Fawcett)</a></dt>
                <dd>Ideally, this would be everybody's first book on machine learning.  The intended audience is both the ML practitioner and the ML product manager.  It's full of important core concepts and practical wisdom.  The math is so minimal that it's perfect for reading on your phone, and I encourage you to read it in parallel to doing this class.  Have your managers read it too.</dd>
